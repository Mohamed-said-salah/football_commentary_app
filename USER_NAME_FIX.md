# User Name Fix for Voice Chat Rooms

## Problem Description
Users were not seeing their names (like "John Doe") in voice chat rooms when logging in with Google. The issue was that the Google Sign-In process wasn't properly extracting and storing the user's display name.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Missing Google Sign-In Scopes
- The Google Sign-In was not requesting the `profile` scope
- This prevented access to the user's display name and profile information

### 2. Incomplete User Profile Updates
- Firebase user profile was not being updated with Google account information
- User's display name remained empty or null

### 3. Poor Fallback Logic
- No proper fallback when display name was missing
- Users appeared as "Anonymous User" or with empty names

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Google Sign-In Configuration
**File**: `lib/core/utils/services/firebase_auth_service.dart`

- Added proper scopes: `['email', 'profile']`
- Configured GoogleSignIn instance with proper scopes
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

```dart
_googleSignIn = GoogleSignIn(
  scopes: [
    'email',
    'profile',
  ],
);
```

### 2. Automatic Profile Updates
- Added `_updateUserProfile()` method to sync Google account info with Firebase
- Automatically updates display name and photo URL
- Only updates when there are actual changes

```dart
Future<void> _updateUserProfile(User firebaseUser, GoogleSignInAccount googleUser) async {
  // Updates display name and photo URL from Google account
  // Ensures Firebase user has the latest profile information
}
```

### 3. Smart Name Extraction with Fallbacks
**File**: `lib/features/auth/data/repos/auth_repo_impl.dart`

Implemented a priority-based name extraction system:

1. **First Priority**: Firebase display name (from Google account)
2. **Second Priority**: Formatted email name (e.g., "john.doe@gmail.com" ‚Üí "John Doe")
3. **Third Priority**: UID-based name (e.g., "User abc123")
4. **Final Fallback**: "Anonymous User"

```dart
String _extractUserName(User firebaseUser) {
  // Multiple fallback strategies to ensure user always has a name
  // Formats email names properly (capitalizes, replaces dots/underscores)
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Logging and Debugging
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the authentication flow
- Logs Google account information during sign-in
- Tracks user entity creation and name extraction
- Helps debug any remaining issues

## How It Works Now

### 1. Google Sign-In Flow
```
User clicks "Sign in with Google" 
‚Üí GoogleSignIn with 'email' and 'profile' scopes
‚Üí Gets user's display name, email, and photo
‚Üí Updates Firebase user profile automatically
‚Üí Creates UserEntity with proper name
```

### 2. Name Extraction Priority
```
1. Google display name (e.g., "John Doe") ‚úÖ
2. Email formatted name (e.g., "john.doe@gmail.com" ‚Üí "John Doe") ‚úÖ
3. UID-based name (e.g., "User abc123") ‚úÖ
4. Fallback ("Anonymous User") ‚úÖ
```

### 3. Voice Chat Room Creation
```
User creates room
‚Üí AuthCubit provides authenticated user
‚Üí UserEntity contains proper name from Google
‚Üí Room created with user's real name
‚Üí Name appears correctly in voice chat
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Sign Out and Sign In Again
- The fix requires a fresh Google sign-in to work properly
- Existing users may need to sign out and back in

### 2. Check Console Logs
- Look for logs showing Google account information
- Verify user entity creation with proper name
- Check room creation logs

### 3. Expected Log Output
```
üîç Google Sign-In Account Info:
  - Display Name: John Doe
  - Email: john.doe@gmail.com
  - Photo URL: https://...
‚úÖ AuthRepo: Created user entity: John Doe (john.doe@gmail.com)
üîç Creating room with user: John Doe (abc123...)
```

## Benefits

1. **Real Names**: Users now see their actual Google account names
2. **Better UX**: No more "Anonymous User" or empty names
3. **Professional Appearance**: Voice chat rooms look more professional
4. **Easy Identification**: Users can easily identify each other
5. **Consistent Experience**: Names work across all features

## Future Improvements

1. **Profile Editing**: Allow users to edit their display names
2. **Custom Avatars**: Support for custom profile pictures
3. **Name Preferences**: Let users choose how their name appears
4. **Privacy Options**: Allow users to use pseudonyms if desired

## Troubleshooting

### If names still don't appear:
1. Check console logs for authentication flow
2. Verify Google account has a display name set
3. Try signing out and back in
4. Check Firebase console for user profile updates
5. Ensure Google Sign-In scopes are properly configured

### Common Issues:
- **Empty names**: Usually means Google account has no display name
- **"Anonymous User"**: Fallback when all other methods fail
- **Email-based names**: Working as intended when display name is missing
