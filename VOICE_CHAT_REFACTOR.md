# Voice Chat Rooms Refactor

## Overview
The voice chat rooms functionality has been refactored into two separate, cleaner views to improve organization and user experience.

## New Structure

### 1. All Voice Chat Rooms View (`AllVoiceChatRoomsView`)
- **Location**: `lib/features/voice_chat/presentation/views/all_voice_chat_rooms_view.dart`
- **Purpose**: Shows all voice chat rooms with a match selector in the app bar
- **Features**:
  - Match selector dropdown in the app bar (clean and accessible)
  - Shows all rooms or filters by specific match
  - Create room functionality for both authenticated and anonymous users
  - Responsive design with proper error handling
  - Route: `/all_voice_chat_rooms_view`

### 2. Single Match Voice Rooms View (`SingleMatchVoiceRoomsView`)
- **Location**: `lib/features/voice_chat/presentation/views/single_match_voice_rooms_view.dart`
- **Purpose**: Focused view for rooms of a specific match
- **Features**:
  - Clean, focused interface for a single match
  - Match info banner at the top with refresh button
  - Back button to return to all rooms view
  - Create room functionality specific to the match
  - **Proper state management**: Loading, Loaded, No Items, Error states
  - **Simple room listing** with proper error handling
  - **Manual refresh** instead of problematic streams
  - Route: `/single_match_voice_rooms_view`

## Key Improvements

### Better Separation of Concerns
- **All Rooms View**: Handles general room browsing and match selection
- **Single Match View**: Focuses on match-specific rooms and interactions

### Improved UI/UX
- Match selector moved to app bar for better accessibility
- Cleaner navigation between views
- Consistent design patterns across both views
- Better error handling and user feedback

### State Management Fixes
- **Replaced problematic streams** with manual refresh methods
- **Clear state handling**: Loading, Loaded, No Items, Error
- **Proper error boundaries** with retry functionality
- **Stable room display** without disappearing content

### Code Organization
- Removed complex conditional logic from single view
- Each view has a single, clear responsibility
- Easier to maintain and extend
- Better separation of authentication flows

## Usage

### Navigation
```dart
// Navigate to all voice chat rooms
context.push(Routes.allVoiceChatRoomsView, {});

// Navigate to specific match voice rooms
context.push(Routes.singleMatchVoiceRoomsView, {
  'matchId': matchId,
  'matchName': matchName,
});
```

### Match Selection
- Use the dropdown in the app bar of `AllVoiceChatRoomsView`
- Select "All Matches" to see all rooms
- Select a specific match to filter rooms

### Creating Rooms
- Both views support room creation
- Authenticated users get full dialog
- Anonymous users get simplified form
- Rooms can be created for specific matches or general use

## Migration Notes

### Old Structure
- `VoiceChatRoomsView` was doing too many things
- Complex match selection logic mixed with room display
- Hard to maintain and extend

### New Structure
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Easier to add new features
- Better user experience
- More maintainable code

## Future Enhancements
- Add real-time match data integration
- Implement room categories or tags
- Add room search and filtering
- Improve match selector with actual match data
- Add room moderation features

## Bug Fixes Applied
- **Fixed disappearing rooms issue** by replacing streams with manual refresh
- **Improved state stability** with proper loading and error states
- **Added refresh functionality** for better user control
- **Enhanced error handling** with retry mechanisms
