# Voice Chat Rooms Refactor

## Overview
The voice chat rooms functionality has been simplified to a single, focused view that handles rooms for specific matches with clean state management.

## Current Structure

### Single Match Voice Rooms View (`SingleMatchVoiceRoomsView`)
- **Location**: `lib/features/voice_chat/presentation/views/single_match_voice_rooms_view.dart`
- **Purpose**: Focused view for rooms of a specific match
- **Features**:
  - Clean, focused interface for a single match
  - Match info banner at the top
  - **Clean state management**: Loading, Result, Fail states
  - Create room functionality specific to the match
  - Refresh functionality
  - Route: `/single_match_voice_rooms_view`

## Key Improvements

### Clean State Management
- **Loading State**: Shows spinner with "Loading rooms..." message
- **Result State**: Displays rooms in a clean list or empty state
- **Fail State**: Shows error message with retry functionality
- **Initial State**: Shows "Initializing..." while setting up

### Simplified Architecture
- **Single view responsibility**: Only handles rooms for specific matches
- **No complex navigation**: Focused on one task
- **Clean error handling**: Clear user feedback and retry options
- **Stable room display**: No disappearing content issues

### Code Organization
- **Single view file**: Easier to maintain and extend
- **Clear state handling**: Loading, Loaded, No Items, Error
- **Proper error boundaries** with retry functionality
- **Stable room display** without disappearing content

## Usage

### Navigation
```dart
// Navigate to specific match voice rooms
context.push(Routes.singleMatchVoiceRoomsView, {
  'matchId': matchId,
  'matchName': matchName,
});
```

### State Flow
```
Initial → Loading → Result (with rooms or empty) ✅
Initial → Loading → Fail (with retry) ✅
```

## Migration Notes

### Old Structure (Removed)
- `VoiceChatRoomsView` - Complex view with multiple responsibilities
- `AllVoiceChatRoomsView` - General rooms view with match selector
- Complex navigation between different room views

### New Structure
- **Single focused view** for match-specific rooms
- **Clean state management** with proper error handling
- **Simplified navigation** - no complex routing
- **Better user experience** with stable content

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Codebase**: Only one view to maintain
2. **Better Performance**: No unnecessary navigation complexity
3. **Cleaner UX**: Users stay focused on specific match rooms
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Single responsibility principle
5. **Stable Experience**: No disappearing rooms or complex state issues

## Future Enhancements
- Add room search and filtering within the match
- Implement room categories or tags
- Add room moderation features
- Improve room creation flow
